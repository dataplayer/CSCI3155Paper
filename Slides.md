I wasn't comfortable with the html file that Nic sent out, so I started work in in MD. I left numbers in just to indicate what I was thinking of including on each slide. Clearly we'll need to move things around and modify them - and delete the numbers.

Classes: The New Sugar in JavaScript
====================================

By Nicandro Flores, Megan Greening, and Brian McWilliams
--------------------------------------------------------

2
How did we get here?
====================

*ECMAScript is a specification for scripting languages
*TC39 is tasked with writing the new spec, called Harmony or ECMAScript 6 (ES6)
*Classes will be added in Harmony
* Programmers are divided on whether or not this is a good thing

3
The Prototypal Way
==================

*JS is object oriented, but it doesn't have Class syntax, as Java does
*Classes can be simulated in JS since objects are highly versatile
*"Prototype" is the property that allows programmers to simluate protoype-based classes

4
Code Example of Prototypes
==========================
*Some or all of the employee example? This might be two slides' worth.

5
More Code to Complete Protype Discussion
========================================

6
Maximally Minimal Classes - What Do Classes Need?
=================================================
*A Class keyword 
*A body that includes the constructor function and instance methods
*Cand declare a class as a subclass of another class using extends
*Super is available from any of the methods or the constructor

7
Formal Class Grammar
====================
<Note/speaking> When we began gathering resources for this topic, we were suprised to be able to apply what we just learned.  The task group was describing the new feature in Backusâ€“Naur Form.   Here we see the top level Class definition.  It is a little harder to make out than what we did, but we can see that ClassDeclaration returns a Binding Identifier and a Class Tail, then a ClassTail.
<End speaking><p>
<center>Class BNF</center>
<pre>
ClassDeclaration: class BindingIdentifier ClassTail
ClassExpression: class BindingIdentifieropt ClassTail
ClassTail: ClassHeritageopt{ ClassBodyopt}
ClassHeritage : extends AssignmentExpression 
ClassBody: ClassElementList 
ClassElementList: 
    ClassElement 
    ClassElementList ClassElement 
ClassElement:
    MethodDefinition;
MethodDefinition :
    PropertyName(FormalParameterList) {FunctionBody}
    *PropertyName(FormalParameterList){FunctionBody}
    get PropertyName ( ){FunctionBody}
    set PropertyName(PropertySetParameterList) {FunctionBody}
</pre>

From Prototype to Class
=======================
*Put code here that relates to previous code, discuss differences

9
How Classes Will Be Used
========================
*Put code that shows how classes work.

10
Pros
====
*I'll leave several sections blank - we can move stuff around as we need to.

15
Main Arguments Against
======================
*JS already has "class" functionality.
*Prototypal classes are available and they work.
*No point in maximally minimal classes.

16
Classes May Add Confusion
=================================
*Adding common features of classes (inheritance, subclasses, etc) will add confusion to JS.
*There will be TWO ways of creating classes and that may lead to errors later on.

17
Prototypal Classes Work
=======================
From Dr. Axel Rauschmayer:
<pre>
    var PersonProto = {
        describe: function () {
            return "Person called "+this.name;
        },
    };
    var jane = {
        __proto__: PersonProto,
        name: "Jane",
    };
    var tarzan = {
        __proto__: PersonProto,
        name: "Tarzan",
    };
    
    console.log(jane.describe()); // Person called Jane
<pre>

18
What's the Point of Minimal Classes?
====================================
*Minimal classes are limited.
*They will not be in regular use for quite awhile.

19
Conclusion
==========
*The decision has been made and classes are coming to JS.
*The good news is that under the hood classes just use the structure that JS already has to work: that means that, in theory, everybody can be happy!
