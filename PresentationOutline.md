Set The Scene
=============

Currently JS does not have Classes. Change is afoot that will introduce classes to JS.

Key Message
===========

Later this year Class syntax will be introduced to JS. Some people think that this is unnecessary since the Class syntax will simply be sugar for class-like structures that are already available. Others think the change will be helpful to new programmers and welcome this change.

Part I
======

- We may want to explain what ECMAS is and what this propasal "says" - we can show part of the grammar if we like.
- Briefly mention the difference between prototypal classes and the new class syntax (maybe use some code?).
- Mention inheritance and constructors.

PartII
======

- Those against the new syntax do not feel the prototypal way of doing things is difficult.
- Walk through the way it is currently done.
- Another issue is that even if programmers can use the new syntax, it will be some time before there is support for it.

Part III
========

- Those for the new syntax point to the fact that is can simplfiy things a lot (shorter code, etc).
- Adding this syntax will bring JS more in line with what people are used to from other languages.
- If you love the prototypal way of doing things you can continue to use it.

Conclusion
==========

Like it or not, this change is coming. Hopefully everybody will be happy with the changes: those who like the prototypal way of doing things can still follow this style while other can begin to use classes.
